Thanks for downloading Oberon!


Requirements for Oberon:
========================
* Windows operating system that has .NET Framework 3.5 or above installed
* A DeviantArt user account
* A user smart enough to actually read the manual


Notes:
======
* If you have .NET 3.5 or higher installed, you do not need to install an older version,
  such as .NET 2.0
* In order to see what version of .NET you're using, look in Control Panel > Add Remove
  Programs and look for "Microsoft .NET Framework"


For Users:
==========
* You can go read the manual now! It is in the /docs folder, and is called Manual.htm


For Developers:
===============
* See the "Module How To" in the manual for a guide on how to create new modules.
